    `dlib <http://dlib.net/>`_ is quite difficult to build on
    Windows for Python 3.6. A compiled version exists on
    `PyPi/dlib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dlib>`_ for Python 3.5
    but the version for Python 3.6 remains unavailable unless you
    are using Anaconda:
    `Installing Dlib on Anaconda Python on Windows <http://www.codesofinterest.com/2016/10/installing-dlib-on-anaconda-python-on.html>`_.
    The blog `Install Dlib on Windows <http://www.learnopencv.com/install-dlib-on-windows/>`_
    even recommends not to try and to use *conda* (with Anaconda) instead:

    ::

        conda install -c conda-forge dlib=19.4

    It seems easier to do it on Ubuntu
    ` <http://www.learnopencv.com/install-dlib-on-ubuntu/>`_.
    As I was still trying to go on with the compilation, I discovered this tool
    `vcpkg <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/09/19/vcpkg-a-tool-to-acquire-and-build-c-open-source-libraries-on-windows/>`_
    which helps installing C++ packages on Windows.
    I followed the instructions to build it:

    ::

        git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg
        powershell -exec bypass scripts\bootstrap.ps1

    And I compiled boost:

    ::

        vcpkg install boost:x64-windows

    Be patient because installing
    `boost <http://www.boost.org/>`_
    takes a while. One issuee though:
    it does not include Python:
    `issue 78 <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues/78>`_.    
    The same instruction works for *dlib*:

    ::

        vcpkg install dlib:x64-windows
